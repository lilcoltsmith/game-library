# game-library
An application for managing your video game collection!

# TO DO
- Filter which consoles show up on dashboard by Major Category (Xbox, Playstation, Sony, etc.)
- Create a "I want these games badly" list
  - Save list of saved games to database by Game ID so we can pull all necessary data
- Try to pull price data from pricecharting: https://www.pricecharting.com/
- Create a Catalog Component for viewing ALL games
  - Should we show all games or view by selected consoles?
- Create a Library Component for viewing your collection of games
  - Filter by console (create a button on the dashboard from the console to the library component that will automatically filter by that console)
